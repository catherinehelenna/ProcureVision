**Background**

Rumah Makan Hati Tenteram, is a restaurant chain with branches across Java Island, tackles the challenge of market price fluctuations, especially in essential ingredients like premium rice, which has seen recent spikes of 15.3%.

"ProcureVision" is an application that uses predictive modeling to anticipate rice prices, considering the current trend of rice scarcity. This enables chefs to create recipes that keep overall Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) within budgetary constraints.

By analyzing historical data from 2023, the app endeavors to provide insightful forecasts. These forecasts empower restaurant management to navigate through the turbulent market conditions strategically. By proactively anticipating price changes, chefs can adeptly formulate recipes that align with budgetary constraints while ensuring that overall Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) remains optimized. 

This app aims to equip Rumah Makan Hati Tenteram with the tools to thrive amidst volatile market dynamics.

 <ins>Conclusion</ins>  
 In conclusion, the analysis results indicate that the polynomial regression model is the most suitable for predicting the price of Beras Premium (premium rice). This conclusion is drawn from the superior performance of the polynomial regression model in terms of MAE and RMSE compared to other models tested.  

 <ins>Business Impacts</ins>  
 Rumah Makan Hati Tenteram can utilize this App to forecast the prices of Premium Rice in the coming months, enabling more precise budgeting strategies considering the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). 

  When prices are predicted to increase in the future and surpass the buffer limit of the COGS budget, management needs to take adaptive measures.
ProcureVision isn't limited to rice alone but can also be applied to other raw materials as needed.
Users feedback will be valuable input for enhancing this application.
